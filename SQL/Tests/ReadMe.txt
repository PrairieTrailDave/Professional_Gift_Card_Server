SQL\Tests

The files in this directory are scripts to test various stored procedures.

These tests are run from SQL Server Management Studio. 

To run a test, open SQL Server Management Studio. 
Then, open the file containing the test you want to run. 
Execute the test. 

The tests build test data in the tables including test merchant id's, test cards, test card holders, test loyalty programs, etc.
Once finished, each test will delete all that test data including entries in the history table.
